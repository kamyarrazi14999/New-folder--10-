        While the man was polishing his new car, his 4 years old son picked up a sharp and scratched some lines on the side of the car.

        Outraged, the man took the child’s hand and hit it many times not realizing he was using a wrench.At the hospital, the child lost all his fingers due to multiple fractures.

        When the child saw his father’s woeful eyes, he asked:
        
        “Dad, when will my fingers grow back…?”
        
        The man was so hurt and speechless; he went back to his new car and started kicking it hard.Devastated by his own action, sitting on the front of that car he looked at the scratches made by his son.

        Moralize:
        
        You know?!
        
        Only a few second come between love and hatred.
        
        That man wasn’t a violent criminal. He was just a normal man and a father who lost control with rage in just a moment …
